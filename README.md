🏢 Employee Management System

The Employee Management System is a simple yet powerful Python application that allows users to manage employee records efficiently. The program is designed with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, ensuring scalability, modularity, and maintainability.

✨ Features
	•	➕ Add Employee: Register a new employee with details like ID, Name, Position, Salary, and Email.
	•	👀 View All Employees: Display a full list of employees in a clean and structured format.
	•	🔍 Search Employee: Quickly find an employee by their unique ID.
	•	✏ Update Employee: Modify details of an existing employee (Name, Position, Salary, Email).
	•	❌ Delete Employee: Remove an employee from the system by ID.
	•	💾 CSV File Integration: All employee data is stored in a CSV file for persistence across program runs.

🛠 Technologies Used
	•	Python 3 (Core language)
	•	CSV Module (For file handling and data storage)
	•	OOP Principles (Encapsulation, Modularity, Reusability)

🚀 How It Works
	1.	Run the program from the terminal or Jupyter Notebook.
	2.	A menu will appear with all options (Add, Update, Delete, Search, List, Exit).
	3.	User input is taken and processed, with error handling for invalid entries.
	4.	Data is saved automatically to employees.csv, ensuring it remains available even after restarting the program.

🎯 Learning Outcomes

This project demonstrates:
	•	File handling with CSV in Python.
	•	Application of OOP design in real-world scenarios.
	•	Building a menu-driven CLI application.
	•	Error handling and data validation.
